# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Aksio platform. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the project, providing context, rationale, and consequences for future reference.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide historical context for future developers
- Enable informed decision-making when revisiting past choices
- Share knowledge across the team
- Support onboarding of new team members

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows a consistent template (see [ADR-XXX-title.md](/docs/adrs/ADR-XXX-title)) with these sections:

1. **Status** - Current state of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded)
2. **Context** - The problem or situation motivating the decision
3. **Decision** - The chosen solution stated clearly
4. **Rationale** - Why this decision was made
5. **Options Considered** - Alternative solutions evaluated with pros/cons
6. **Consequences** - Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
7. **Security Implications** - Security, privacy, and compliance considerations
8. **Implementation** - Steps needed to implement the decision
9. **Risks and Mitigation** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
10. **Dependencies** - Related systems or decisions affected
11. **Related Decisions** - Links to other relevant ADRs
12. **Notes** - Additional context, references, or links
13. **Approval** - Decision makers and approval date

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Summary |

| [ADR-005](/docs/adrs/ADR-005-authentication-strategy) | Authentication and User Management Strategy | Accepted | 2025-08-14 | Self-managed authentication with 16+ age restriction for compliance simplicity |
| [ADR-006](/docs/adrs/ADR-006-database-migration-strategy) | Database Migration Strategy | Accepted | 2025-08-14 | golang-migrate with phased implementation from MVP to enterprise scale |
| [ADR-007](/docs/adrs/ADR-007-secrets-management) | Secrets Management Strategy | Accepted | 2025-08-14 | Google Secret Manager for secure credential storage with rotation and audit capabilities* |

*Implementation details are documented internally for security reasons.

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**: Start with [ADR-XXX-title.md](/docs/adrs/ADR-XXX-title)
2. **Assign a number**: Use the next sequential number (e.g., ADR-006)
3. **Use descriptive filename**: Format as `ADR-NNN-brief-description.md`
4. **Set initial status**: Start with "Proposed" or "Draft"
5. **Fill all sections**: Provide comprehensive information
6. **Focus on "why"**: Emphasize reasoning over implementation details
7. **Consider security**: Always include security and privacy implications
8. **Review process**: 
   - Submit PR with proposed ADR
   - Team review and discussion
   - Update based on feedback
   - Approval and merge

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed/Draft** - Under discussion and review
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and will be/is implemented
3. **Rejected** - Decision was considered but not adopted
4. **Deprecated** - Decision no longer applies or has been reversed
5. **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer ADR (link to replacement)

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs

- **Be concise but complete** - Include all necessary context without excessive detail
- **Write for the future** - Assume readers have no current context
- **Include real data** - Use metrics, benchmarks, and evidence where possible
- **Document trade-offs** - Be honest about disadvantages and risks
- **Link related decisions** - Show how decisions connect and depend on each other

### When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Selecting fundamental technologies (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Choosing architectural patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless)
- Making security decisions (authentication, encryption, access control)
- Defining major system boundaries or interfaces
- Decisions that are expensive to reverse
- Choices that affect multiple teams or systems

### When NOT to Write an ADR

Skip ADRs for:
- Implementation details that can easily change
- Coding style preferences (use style guides instead)
- Temporary workarounds or quick fixes
- Decisions with minimal impact or easy reversibility

## Security and Privacy Considerations

Given Aksio's educational context, every ADR must consider:

- **Student Data Protection** - FERPA and GDPR compliance
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Secure access controls
- **Data Encryption** - Protection at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging** - Tracking access and changes
- **Transparency** - User visibility into data usage
- **Data Retention** - Clear policies on data lifecycle

## Questions or Suggestions?

If you have questions about ADRs or suggestions for improving this process:
1. Open an issue in the repository
2. Discuss in team meetings
3. Propose changes via pull request
